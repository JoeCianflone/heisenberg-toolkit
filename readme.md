# Heisenberg Toolkit

## Introduction

Heisenberg is a toolkit of code to help you speed up the development of your front end projects that do not rely on frameworks like Angular or Vuejs.

### What's in the Box?

Heisenberg wants to get a whole bunch of low-level tasks out of your way so you can jump into coding your app.

When you download Heisenberg you get the following out-of-the-box:

+ Basic gulp tasks: Sass, Image Minification, PNG/SVG Sprites, JS/Sass Concatenation and Minification
+ A sensible way of organizing your Sass and Javascript
+ Mixins that will make your life easier
+ Grids with Susy, Media Queries, Normalized CSS with some sane defaults
+ Bower, HandlebarsJS and EditorConfig files
+ VanillaJS that helps you with events and ajax calls without the weight of jQuery

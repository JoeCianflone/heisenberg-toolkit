# Heisenberg Toolkit

## Introduction

Heisenberg is a toolkit of code to help you speed up the development of your front end projects.

### Toolkit? You Mean Framework?

No, Heisenberg isn't what I could call a framework. A framework is the support structure for code. Frameworks *should* make your life a lot easier by building out a bunch of boilerplate code and helping you out with convenience methods and objects.

This doesn't really do that.

Heisenberg does give you a base to build on, but it's more of a foundation--bits of code that you'll almost always use on every project, put together and ready to go.

## What's in the Box?

Heisenberg comes with some base things for you:

1. Gulp and all the gulp tasks ready to go
2. Sass
3. Vanilla JavaScript put together in a sensible way
4. Image minification
5. Spriteing capabilities
6. Bower
7. Handlebars
8. Easy Configuration
9. Editor Config files
10. JS/CSS uglification and minification
11. Browser normalization
12. A standard sane way to write your code

That's a lot to say, so let's take a look at some stuff to see what we mean.

## Gulp

Gulp tasks come ready to go and everything is highly configurable just check out `gulp/config.js`

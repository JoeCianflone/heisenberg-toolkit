 * If you want to use Bootstrap strip out all of these guys.  Normalize is
 * redundant (it's included in bootstrap) and Bootstrap comes with a grid.
 * Font awesome isn't needed either, so you can strip that out too, but I
 * personally like those fonts better and I know most developers and up putting
 * that in at some point anyway.  Include-media is a great tool for working
 * with media queries, I think you should look into it, but again, with Bootstrap
 * it may not be needed.

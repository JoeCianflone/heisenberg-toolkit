 * Fonts

 * fonts in my designs.  To keep it simple, I have two different font types:
 * copy and headlines.  They are exactly what they sound like.

 * Make sure you also define "fallbacks" on the off chance Google fonts goes
 * down or your user is on a crappy connection.

/**
 * Colors
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Colors have always been a bit of a weird thing to name IMO.  Why exatly is
 * this color the primary brand color...and wtf does that mean in relation to
 * a designed page?  We don't do that here.  Name the variable to match what
 * the color is, this way you don't get into weird situations where you're
 * using $header-blue or $primary-brand where the name doesn't make sense
 * and the context is all weird.
